From April 1st, I started off with my first month plan. I kicked off with **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** and boy this has been a tough ride. This is an unusual book which deals with programming in a totally different manner and makes you learn where to look for details and where to ignore them. It changed the way I perceived programming.

The idea is to take the course thoroughly and seriously. This is going to be a cover-by-cover reading and attempting all the exercises and spending considerable amount of time trying to understand what the problem wants to say before giving up. The _Abelson and Sussman_ lectures from back in 1986 are golden and I am following them to complement the text book. Although I am using the second edition of the book, and the lectures are based on the first edition- it shouldn't make much difference for the ideas conveyed are the same.

 The SICP challenge is going to be in the [Projects][projects] section of the website alongside other personal challenges. I will be posting my notes, solutions, takeaways, mistakes and troubles I faced while dealing with the exercises and summaries of each chapter in [The SICP Challenge][sicp-challenge]. This can be a reference to new programmers in the future trying to deal with SICP. All the code will be available in my [github repository for SICP][github].
