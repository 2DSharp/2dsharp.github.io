I finally came up with a plan. I have four months of vacation (technically a week less since I already wasted one). And I have had enough sleep to make up for my insomnia over the last few weeks. I am ready to rumble. I was all excited to jump into doing something when I realized that I didn't have a plan. And then I today I had some realizations that my relationship isn't going very well either, I was broken at some point. Well, this is my escape route and step one is: _making a plan_.

Now, I have been researching and reading a lot. And one thing hit me hard, with all these years of experience in my bag- I am still a noob. I can't deny being honest to myself. So, what do I do? I start from the ground up. Once again, but this time- with active self supervision. I have almost 14 hours a day of work time available, I can nicely divide my time based on what I feel like doing at any part of the day. Now the idea of this crash course is to have a flexible timing.

**So here's the big plan**

 The basis of the plan is to replicate the process of learning computer science of the people who started off pretty much when Computer Science became a thing. I don't have a Commodore64, and I don't have punch cards. So, what I am going to do is start off froma very low level (Assembly and maybe digital circuits at some point?) to higher levels of abstraction and figure out what the buzz words these days are really all about.

* Month 1: **The basics** - I am going to start off with 3 things to cover for the first month, and that's the basics to give me a kickstart. 
	
	* _MIT's SICP course_ by **Prof. Abelson and Sussman**: Hardcore computer science lovers have shown a peaked interest in this course material. This course (book + lectures) altogether gives you neat ideas about computer science, makes you see how simple data and code can be and how beatuiful abstractions are made out of them. I have two options: *Berkeley's SICP course using Python* (a more approachable way), or *MIT's original SICP lectures using MIT Scheme (LISP)*. I am going to go with Scheme, because I do want to learn a LISP dialect and the last time I tried it, it did feel rewarding and I want a challenge. Plus, I am an GNU/Emacs user, I might need some LISP hacking now and then. 
	Anyway, this course should clear up my blurred vision of how things work and hopefully I will get a new perspective.
	
	* _Algorithms and Data Structures_: Something I have ignored for quite sometime, but as they say, it forms the basis of computer science. Now I already had taken a basic DSA course in college, although I want to get back to it. I have some good material for this: _Algorithms_ by **Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani**, _Introduction to Algorithms_ by **CLRS**, _MIT lectures 6.006, 6.046J and 6.851_. I think I am going to skip 6.851 for now, and a lot of parts of CLRS, but I will try out the rest and see how far I can go.

	* _The C Programming language_ by **Dennis Ritchie**: Now, this is for getting low level. I had already started off with the language, I can write a few dummy college programs with it, but I realized I really needed to know about pointers, threads, garbage collection and memory management. Since I am going low level, I can get more of those segfaults, work with valgrind to find memory leaks and learn a debugger. Also, C is going to be the language where I implement most of my algorithms and data structures in. The language is small, so this one should take me about 10 days to get acquainted with. It will be fun!

* Month 2:

	* Discrete math
	* Operating systems
	* Design patterns with Java and JavaFX
	* IoT project (Python)


* Month 3:

	* Computer Architecture
	* GTK+ and QT frameworks (C++?)
	* Compilers
	
* Month 4:

	* Hadoop
	* Machine learning and related calculus
	* Networking
