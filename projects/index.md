  <div class="project-description">
    Usually I would build something every vacation, this time I decided to get back to the basics and fill in the gaps I had. I started off with an fun and rigorous challenge: Tackling Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. A classic MIT course which teaches you programming in the way you should be taught. It is not an easy course, but the dopamine boost after completing the exercises is worth it.

  <div class="project-description">
    A semi-autonomous dog robot based on Arduino geared towards security. It calls and texts you about disturbances in your house, you can take it out for walks and it will help you navigate even if you are blind or you could just use it as an RC toy with any smartphone.
