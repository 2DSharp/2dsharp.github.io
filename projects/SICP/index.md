**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**

Usually I would build something every vacation, this time I decided to get back to the basics and fill in the gaps I had. I started off with an fun and rigorous challenge: Tackling Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. 

It's a classic MIT course which teaches you programming in the way you should be taught. It is not an easy course, but the dopamine boost after completing the exercises is worth it.
    
I took up the SICP challenge as a project in my summer 2018. The blog posts about SICP [can be found here][sicp-cat] regarding any updates about the challenge.
All the source code can be found at my github repository: [github.com/2DSharp/SICP][github]. 

I didn't have enough time to complete the exercise by exercise explanation part, I will get there when I get a slightly lighter schedule. Till then, feel free to check out my github repo.
