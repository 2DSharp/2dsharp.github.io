Hi, I am **Dedipyaman**. I am a software developer and a student.

My interests range from linux servers to compilers, from Dragon ball to Avengers. I build stuff out of tiny pieces of plain text and turn it into something useful. 

I have worked on domains varying from the web, cloud, native apps, cross platform apps, college utility systems, server apps, robotics to home automation software. I am a full-time Linux guy and a supporter of FOSS.


I am currently in college pursuing an engineering degree in Computer Science, Junior year.
